Installation:
-------------
To run this notebook interactively you better have installed Anaconda previously.

The notebook read 2 files you have to copy in the same repository to launch the notebook :

train.csv that contains the "SalePrice" column that permit to train my models

The method used to rank submissions is "RMSE" for Rooted Mean Squared Error.

RMSE =  Σ ((zfi – Zoi)Sup>2) / N

with :
Σ = summation (“add up”)
(zfi – Zoi)Sup>2 = differences, squared
N = sample size.
